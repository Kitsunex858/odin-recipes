    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaetzle are traditional German dumplings. You can also 
      mince a few pieces of bacon in a pan, heat the cooked 
      spaetzle in the bacon drippings and omit the butter.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch freshly ground white pepper</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>¼ cup milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill a large pot halfway full with water and bring 
          to a boil. Adjust heat so water just simmers.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, mix together flour, nutmeg, salt, and 
          white pepper in a medium bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Whisk eggs together in a small bowl. Add eggs 
          alternately with milk to dry ingredients. Stir 
          until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>Working in batches, press dough through a spaetzle 
          maker, or through a large-holed colander or metal 
          grater, into simmering water. Cook 5 to 8 minutes. 
          Remove with a slotted spoon or spider and drain well.
      </li>
      <li>Melt butter in a large skillet. Add spaetzle and 
          cook, stirring gently, until heated through. Serve 
          sprinkled with parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
